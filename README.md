# Angela Amaro's Portfolio

## Description

In this portfolio I have made a foundational website with functionality to display my knowledge of coding and past projects. As an artist looks are everything to me so I made sure the website was clearly organized and had a color scheme that was not to jarring on the eyes. I also made little style changes to make the website styling more seamless. This webite will also track future projects to come which is why it was important to include a navigation bar that was interactive. By doing this, no matter how long the website gets the navigation bar can jump to that section of the page. 

I built this website completely from scratch, I started with adding an index.html and css style sheet for a base. I built the skeleton of the website in the index.html file and attached links to images and the navbar. Next I made selectors to connect to the CSS styling and from there styled the website to look more professional and display my past works in a more organized fashion.
